# Open-Woodwind-Project

The Open Woodwind Project is an opensource woodwind controller based on the Teensy, MPR121, and BNO055 IMU. 

See https://hackaday.io/project/2992-the-open-woodwind-project for porject log information.

I'll be including source code, and the 3D printing files necessary to reproduce this project in full here.
